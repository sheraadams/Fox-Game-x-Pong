This game was inspired by LearnOpenGL's Breakout game. The game mechanics and physics are a bit different. The inverted rendering is used here but with different mechanics again. A pause state, AI state and fruit drop state were added for fun. A second player was added that uses AI to return the ball each time. User can select AI from the main menu to have two AI players play the game instead.
